I am passionate about agriculture, with a personal interest in Agronomic research and crop production.
Working on crop models, especially on Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) and other Crop simulation models.
I love my work in the field of agronomy. My passion is also about making food production more sustainable, and in doing so contributing to a food secure future for the growing world population.
